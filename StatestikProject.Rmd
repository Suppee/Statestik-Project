## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

```

Install tidyverse package (incl. ggplot)
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
#install.packages("tidyverse")
```

Read datasheet on pokemon
```{r}
Pokemon <- readr::read_csv("pokemon.csv")
```

# Datasheet General Information

Datasheet Column Names
```{r}
colnames(Pokemon)
```
Datasheet summary
```{r}
summary(Pokemon)
```

I believe that normal type pokemon are the most common type of pokemon.

```{r}
ggplot(data = Pokemon) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes( x = "Type 1", fill = "Type 2"), color = 'black')
```
```{r}
colors <- c("cyan","bisque","brown","coral","dodgerblue","gainsboro","gold",
            "darkorchid","chartreuse","aquamarine","blue","black","darkorange",
            "seagreen","salmon","red","palevioletred","palegreen")

ggplot(Pokemon,
                aes(x=reorder(`Type 1`,`Type 1`,
                              function(x)-length(x)))) +
  geom_bar(fill=colors,col='black')+
  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0,120))+
    ylab("Count") +
  xlab("Type 1 of Non-Legendary Pokemons")
```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
